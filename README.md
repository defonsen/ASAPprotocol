## Overview

ASAP Protocol empowers decentralized organizations (DAOs) by integrating AI-driven agents directly on-chain. These agents autonomously vote on proposals, enabling a streamlined decision-making process that reduces friction and complexity. With ASAP Protocol, community members can delegate their votes to these trusted agents, ensuring that every voice is represented—even if they lack technical expertise.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Governance:** AI agents cast votes on behalf of community members, reducing the delays associated with manual voting.
- **Enhanced Community Participation:** Members can delegate their voting rights to trusted AI agents, ensuring broader and more inclusive participation.
- **Simplified Operations:** The protocol minimizes the technical barriers to DAO involvement, making it easier for every member to contribute to governance.
- **Trust & Transparency:** Through on-chain attestation and peer review, the system builds a robust reputation for each AI agent, ensuring reliable and transparent operations.

## The Problem It Solves

1. **Efficient Governance:** Traditional DAO systems often suffer from slow, cumbersome manual voting processes. ASAP Protocol automates these processes using AI agents.
2. **Enhanced Participation:** By allowing delegation of votes to trusted AI agents, community members can contribute without needing to be actively involved in every decision.
3. **Simplified Governance:** The protocol reduces the complexity inherent in blockchain-based governance, making participation accessible to non-technical users.

## Technologies Used

### AgentKit
- **Purpose:** Utilizes agent-based decision-making to enhance on-chain governance.
- **Functionality:** Integrates with ASAP Protocol to enable AI-powered proposals, voting, and delegation.

### On-Chain Attestation
- **Reputation System:** AI agents gain authority based on their on-chain reputation.
- **Peer Review:** Agents can verify and attest to the actions of other agents, bolstering trust and transparency within the system.

### Blockchain Integration
- **Smart Contracts:** Developed in Solidity, these contracts manage DAO operations and underpin the proposal voting logic.
- **Governance Protocol:** Custom actions allow AI agents to actively participate in and influence proposal outcomes.

## Built With

- **AgentKit** — For AI-based agent delegation and proposal voting.
- **Solidity** — For writing on-chain smart contracts.
- **Foundry** — For testing and developing Solidity contracts.
- **Hardhat** — A development framework for smart contracts.
- **React** — For building a user-friendly frontend interface.
- **Express.js** — To support backend API communication.
- **Ethers.js** — For facilitating blockchain interactions on the frontend.

## Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/asap-protocol.git
   cd asap-protocol
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   - For the frontend:
     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ```
   - For the backend:
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npm install
     ```
   - For Solidity contracts:
     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev hardhat foundry
     ```

3. **Configuration**
   - Update the `.env` files with your blockchain provider keys and other required configurations.
   - Configure smart contract deployment settings in Hardhat.

4. **Running the Application**
   - Start the backend server:
     ```bash
     npm run start:backend
     ```
   - Run the frontend:
     ```bash
     npm run start:frontend
     ```

## Usage

1. **Deploy Smart Contracts:** Use Hardhat or Foundry to deploy the Solidity contracts on your desired network.
2. **Interact with the System:** Once deployed, users can delegate their voting power to AI agents, propose changes, and monitor on-chain governance activities through the user interface.
3. **Monitor Governance:** Utilize the on-chain attestation and peer review system to observe and verify AI agent activities and reputation.
